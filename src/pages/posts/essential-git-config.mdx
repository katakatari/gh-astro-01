## Goal

- **Edit commit messages using VS Code**
- **Add default push branch**
- **Add a default global `.gitignore`**

As developers, Git is a tool we use daily. Most of the time, the commands we use are the same: `git add <filename>`, `git commit -m <message>`, and `git push origin <branch_name>`. While using the default commands is good enough, wouldn't it be better to shorten some commands that require additional input, like `git commit` and `git push`, to reduce the chance of making mistakes?

## Write commit messages from VS Code

When I first learned how to code, editing code using nano scared me. I was (and still am) unfamiliar with it. Shortcuts that are familiar to me cannot be used out-of-the-box in nano, and I didn't even know how to close the program!

Fortunately, you don't have to learn nano to write long commit messages. You can use VS Code instead, so you don't have to develop new muscle memory just to write your commit messages in nano. So, how do we change the text editor when using `git commit` while omitting the `-m` for a long commit message?

### Steps

- **Open .gitconfig**

  From your terminal, type `code ~/.gitconfig` on Mac or Linux, and `code %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig` on Windows.

- **Add config**

  Add the following to the `.gitconfig` file:
  ```
  # Your other configuration
  [core]
	  editor = code --wait
  ```
Now, every time you use `git commit` and press `enter`, it will open a new file for you to edit the commit message in VS Code. When you're done editing, you can close the file, and the message will be committed to your codebase and ready to be pushed.

## Default push to the current branch

Another configuration that will increase your productivity is the ability to push your committed code to the current branch you are working on. Instead of `git push origin <branch_name>`, you can now simply use `git push`, and it will push your committed code to the current branch you are on.

### Steps

- **Open `.gitconfig`**

- **Add config**

Add the following to the `.gitconfig` file:

  ```
  # Your other configuration
  [push]
  	autoSetupRemote = true
	  default = current
  ```
Now, from your local machine, when you check out a new branch, work on a new feature, and want to push your changes to your Git repository on GitHub, you can simply write `git push`, and it will automatically create a new branch on GitHub and push the changes to that branch.

## Global .gitignore

Another useful configuration is a global `.gitignore`. It helps to make sure you don't accidentally push files that might be confidential or unimportant, like `.env` or `node_modules`. While it's best practice to always include a `.gitignore` in every project, having a global `.gitignore` serves as a safety net in case you forget to add it to a project and accidentally push sensitive information like `API_KEY` or `DATABASE_URL` for the whole world to see. Yikes!

So how do you set it up?

### Steps

- **Create .gitignore**

The filename can be `.gitignore` or anything, but it's recommended to use `.gitignore_global` to differentiate it from other `.gitignore` files.

- **Include file(s) or directory(ies)**

Add the file(s) or directory(ies) that you want to be ignored by default in every project.

  ```
  # Environment Variables
  .env
  .env.*

  # Dependencies
  node_modules/

  # Your other files or directories to be ignored
  ```

- **Add the `.gitignore` to `.gitconfig`**

Lastly, you will need to add `.gitignore_global` to your global `.gitconfig` by adding this line `excludesfile = /home/bayuutomo/.gitignore_global` to the `[core]` block.

  ```
  # your other config
  [core]
	  excludesfile = <the_location_of_your_.gitignore_global> # or /home/<username>/<.gitignore_filename> on linux and mac
	  excludesfile = <the_location_of_your_.gitignore_global> # or  %USERPROFILE%\<.gitignore_filename> on windows
  ```


Now, every time you are working on a new project, this `.gitignore` will be applied by default, so you can be sure that no more `API_KEY` is being shared with the world when you forget to add it to the project's `.gitignore`. You can test this by creating the file or directory that you have included in the global `.gitignore` and running `git status` in the terminal.

These are some essential `.gitconfig` settings that I use throughout my developer journey. I hope they benefit you, and I might add more when I find other useful configurations in the future.
