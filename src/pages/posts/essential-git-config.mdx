## Goal

- [**Write commit messages using VS Code**](#write-commit-messages-from-vs-code)
- [**Add default push branch**](#default-push-to-the-current-branch)
- [**Ignoring file or directory**](#ignore-file-or-directory)
- [**Add a default global .gitignore**](#global-gitignore)

As developers, Git is a tool we use daily. Most of the time, the commands we use are the same: `git add <filename>`, `git commit -m <message>`, and `git push origin <branch_name>`. While using the default commands is good enough, wouldn't it be better to shorten some commands that require additional input, like `git commit` and `git push`, to reduce the chance of making mistakes?

## Write commit messages from VS Code

When I first learned how to code, editing code using nano scared me. I was (and still am) unfamiliar with it. Shortcuts that are familiar to me cannot be used out-of-the-box in nano, and I didn't even know how to close the program!

Fortunately, you don't have to learn nano to write long commit messages. You can use VS Code instead, so you don't have to develop new muscle memory just to write your commit messages in nano. So, how do we change the text editor when using `git commit` while omitting the `-m` for a long commit message?

### Steps

- **Open .gitconfig**

  From your terminal, type `code ~/.gitconfig` on Mac or Linux, and `code %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig` on Windows.

- **Add config**

  Add the following to the `.gitconfig` file:
  ```
  # Your other configuration
  [core]
	  editor = code --wait
  ```
Now, every time you use `git commit` and press `enter`, it will open a new file for you to edit the commit message in VS Code. When you're done editing, you can close the file, and the message will be committed to your codebase and ready to be pushed.

## Default push to the current branch

Another configuration that will increase your productivity is the ability to push your committed code to the current branch you are working on. Instead of `git push origin <branch_name>`, you can now simply use `git push`, and it will push your committed code to the current branch you are on.

### Steps

- **Open `.gitconfig`**

- **Add config**

Add the following to the `.gitconfig` file:

  ```
  # Your other configuration
  [push]
  	autoSetupRemote = true
	  default = current
  ```
Now, from your local machine, when you check out a new branch, work on a new feature, and want to push your changes to your Git repository on GitHub, you can simply write `git push`, and it will automatically create a new branch on GitHub and push the changes to that branch.

## Ignore File or Directory

As a developer, there are often files or directories that we want to be ignored and not committed to `GitHub`. The way we tell `git` to ignore a specific file or directory is by adding it to the `.gitignore` file. The best practice is to put the `.gitignore` file in the project root directory. By default, `git` will ignore any file or directory listed in the `.gitignore` file, so we don't have to do any other configuration. So, how do we ignore a specific file or directory?

- **Ignoring a file**
  
  To add a file to be ignored by `git`, write the absolute path to that file from the project root directory. For example, if we have a `.env` file we want to ignore, we can simply add `.env` to the project's `.gitignore` file. And that's it! Simple, isn't it?

  Now, what if we want to add multiple files that have the same prefix or extension? Do we have to write every single item to the `.gitignore` file? Yikes!

  Fortunately, we don't have to do that. We can simply use the wildcard `*` as a replacement. For example, when we need to ignore any file starting with `.env`, such as `.env.production`, `.env.local`, etc., we can simply write `.env*` and `git` will ignore any file starting with `.env`.
  
  Likewise, when we need to ignore any file ending with a specific pattern, we can use `*.ignorethis`. This means any file ending with `.ignorethis` will be ignored by `git`.

  ```
  # .gitignore
  # env file
  # ignore only .env file
  .env

  # ignore any .env file
  .env*

  # ignore any file ending with ignore_this
  *ignore_this
  ```

- **Ignoring a directory**

  We've learned that the way to ignore a file is by adding the absolute path to the specific file we want to ignore. But, how about ignoring a directory?

  Well, it's the same as adding a file to the `.gitignore` file, either by using a prefix, suffix, or matching the absolute path. For example, when we want to add `node_modules` to be ignored by `git`, we can write `node_modules` to `.gitignore` and `git` will ignore every file inside `node_modules`.

  ```
  # .gitignore
  # ignore node_modules directory and every file inside of it
  node_modules # or /node_modules or node_modules/ is the same
  ```

- **Ignoring all files or directories except some**

  Now that we've learned how to ignore files and directories, the next tip we're going to learn is how to make an exception. For example, let's say that you want to ignore all `.env` files except `.env.example`. The way to do it is to write the exception with an exclamation mark at the start.

  ```
  # .gitignore
  # ignore all .env files
  .env*

  # except .env.example
  !.env.example
  ```

Next, we will learn how to add a safety measure in case we forget to add a `.gitignore` file to our repository.

## Global .gitignore

Another useful configuration is a global `.gitignore`. It helps ensure you don't accidentally push files that might be confidential or unimportant, like `.env` or `node_modules`. While it's best practice to always include a `.gitignore` in every project, having a global `.gitignore` serves as a safety net in case you forget to add it to a project and accidentally push sensitive information like `API_KEY` or `DATABASE_URL` for the whole world to see. Yikes!

So how do you set it up?

### Steps

- **Create .gitignore**

The filename can be `.gitignore` or anything, but it's recommended to use `.gitignore_global` to differentiate it from other `.gitignore` files.

- **Include file(s) or directory(ies)**

Add the file(s) or directory(ies) that you want to be ignored by default in every project.

  ```
  # Environment Variables
  .env
  .env.*

  # Dependencies
  node_modules/

  # Your other files or directories to be ignored
  ```

- **Add the `.gitignore` to `.gitconfig`**

Lastly, you will need to add `.gitignore_global` to your global `.gitconfig` by adding this line `excludesfile = /home/<username>/.gitignore_global` to the `[core]` block.

  ```
  # your other config
  # assuming you put .gitignore_filename in your root directory
  
  # on Linux or Mac
  [core]
      excludesfile = <the_location_of_your_.gitignore_global>
      # or /home/<username>/<.gitignore_filename>
  
  # on Windows
  [core]
      excludesfile = <the_location_of_your_.gitignore_global> 
      # or ~\<.gitignore_filename>
      # equivalent of Drive:\<Users>\<your_username>
  ```

You might notice that on Windows, the root directory is usually equivalent to `Drive:\Users\<your_username>`. To allow `.gitconfig` to detect your `.gitignore` file in your root directory, you should write `~/<.gitignore_filename>`. However, if you want to access it via PowerShell, the CLI command is `%USERPROFILE%\<directory_or_filename>`.

Now, every time you work on a new project, this `.gitignore` will be applied by default. This ensures that sensitive information, such as `API_KEY`, is not accidentally shared when you forget to add it to the project's `.gitignore`. You can test this by creating the file or directory that you have included in the global `.gitignore` and running `git status` in the terminal.

You can confirm it by using `git status` in your current git repository. Files or directories that you've added to your global `.gitignore` will not be shown in the unstaged files or directories. However, remember that this is only a guardrail, and you should follow best practices by adding a `.gitignore` file to your repository when necessary.

These are some essential `.gitconfig` settings that I use throughout my developer journey. I hope they benefit you, and I might add more when I find other useful configurations in the future.
