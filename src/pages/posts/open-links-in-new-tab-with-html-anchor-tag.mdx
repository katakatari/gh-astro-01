## Goal

1. **Adding "open in a new tab" functionality to the anchor `<a>` tag**

When creating a website, you might need to redirect visitors to another page on your site or to an entirely different website. By default, the anchor `<a>` tag opens the link in the current page. But what if you want to change this behavior to open the link in a new tab instead?

Fortunately, it's as simple as adding the HTML attribute `target="_blank"` to the anchor `<a>` tag.

Example: `<a href="#" target="_blank">Link</a>` results in <a href="#" target="_blank">Link</a>.

When you click the link above, the browser will open a new tab and redirect you to the URL provided in the `href` attribute. Simple, isn't it?

Additionally, you might want to add the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute to enhance security and privacy. This prevents the new page from accessing the `window.opener` property and stops the browser from sending the `Referer` header.

Final code: `<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Target Link</a>`
